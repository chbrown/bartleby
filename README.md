A very _faithful_ BibTeX parser.

- Preserves comments, order, formatting, string interpolations
- _Mostly_ idempotent at its core
  * Whitespace outside values is always standardized
- Implements various levels of cleaning up / standardization beyond whitespace

## Parsatron API

The whole thing is only 316 LOC, and mostly easily readable:
<https://github.com/youngnh/parsatron/blob/master/src/clj/the/parsatron.clj>

> A "parser" is, technically, a function that takes 5 arguments and returns a special value
run is a function that takes a parser and an input, and returns the output (or throws)

The parser 5-tuple:

    state, cok, cerr, eok, eerr

* `eok` is called on when encountering valid empty input
  - it's a function that takes a new token from the input stream, and the current state, and... returns a new state?
* `cok` is called to consume valid non-empty input


#### Built-in parser creators

* `token` takes a single predicate and returns a parser that accepts / rejects based on that predicate and returns the input unchanged
* `char` takes a character and creates a parser that accepts and returns that character only
* `any-char` creates a parser that accepts any character
* `letter` creates a parser that accepts any alphabetic character
* `digit` creates a parser that accepts any numeric character
* `string` takes a string and creates a parser that accepts only that string
* `eof` creates a parser that throws on any input; it only succeeds if there's nothing left, in which case it returns `nil`

#### combiners

* `>>` chains multiple parsers together, in a serial sequence, but it only returns the last parser's result
* `times` (like `{n}`) takes a count (positive integer) and a parser and chains that many of parser together, but returns a sequence
* `many` (like `*`) takes a parser and greedily accepts as much of the input stream as that parser will accept, or nothing (in which case it returns an empty vector)
  - TODO: figure out why it returns a list usually, and a vector for empty results
* `many1` (like `+`) is like `many` but requires at least one match
* `attempt` (like `?`) tries a parser and consumes nothing if it fails
* `lookahead` applies a parser and returns the result but does not consume anything
* `choice` takes multiple parsers and tries each one in turn
* `either` is like `choice` but only takes two parsers
* if `choice` (or `either`) fail to match any (either) of their parsers, it throws an error that is the concatenation of the error messages for each of the parsers, which seems kind of messy but maybe can be configured?
* `between` takes three parsers, `[open close content]`, and runs them like `(>> open content close)`, but returns only the result of the `content` parser.

#### higher level / macro stuff

* `defparser` defines a parser-creator function, which, when called, returns a parser along the lines of `token` or `any-char`
* `let->>` binds a sequence of parsers to their result values
  - > Every right hand side in a `let->>` binding form has to evaluate to a parser.
