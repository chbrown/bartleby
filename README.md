A very _faithful_ BibTeX parser.

- Preserves comments, order, formatting, string interpolations
- _Mostly_ idempotent at its core
  * Whitespace outside values is always standardized
- Implements various levels of cleaning up / standardization beyond whitespace


## Use as jar

1. Go to [releases](https://github.com/chbrown/bartleby/releases) and download the top (latest) <code>bartleby-<em>x.y.z</em>-standalone.jar</code>
2. Ensure you have `java` installed (`java -version` should print out your version)
3. In your shell, run `java -jar bartleby-*.jar --help`, which will print out a help message describing all command line functionality.
  * For example, `java -jar bartleby-*.jar cat my.bib their.bib` will read each of `my.bib` and `their.bib` and print the formatted BibTeX to `stdout` in that order.


## Compile and install as binary

    lein bin
    cp $(find target -type f -perm +111) /usr/local/bin/bart


## Recipes

Reformat a single .bib file, in-place:

    bart cat <research.bib | sponge research.bib

Delete .bib file entries not used in LaTeX document:

    bart select {paper.aux,research.bib} | sponge research.bib


## Alternatives

* [`bibexport`](https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/biblio/bibtex/utils/bibexport/)
  - Cleverly uses the BibTeX compiler and a special `export.bst` style file to render BibTeX natively.
  - But it is not very faithful:
    + Unrecognized fields (those outside the standard 22 + 7 special names hard-coded into `export.bst`) are deleted
    + Comments are deleted
    + All fields are ordered alphabetically
    + All entries are ordered by first appearance in the document / `.aux` file
  - And the output format is not customizable (unless you modify the `export.bst` file):
    + All case-insensitive keywords (pubtype and field keys) are lowercased
    + All fields keys are indented with two spaces, and the field values are all aligned at column 19
    + Lines are wrapped at 78 characters

## Release instructions

### Cutting and deploying a new version

Update the version manually in `project.clj` and `README.md`, commit those changes, and push.

Then add a tag and push:

    tag=v$(lein pprint :version | tr -d \")
    git tag $tag
    git push --tags

Finally, deploy to [Clojars](https://clojars.org/):

    lein deploy

* _TODO_: customize `:release-tasks` and use `lein release :major / :minor / :patch`


### Generating and publishing documentation

Create a fresh clone from the `gh-pages` branch:

    repo=${TMPDIR-/tmp/}bartleby-gh-pages
    git clone git@github.com:chbrown/bartleby.git -b gh-pages $repo

Now, back in this repo on the `master` branch, generate the documentation directly into that clone:

    lein update-in :codox assoc :output-path \"$repo\" -- codox
    rev=$(git rev-parse --short master)

Then go to that repo's directory, commit the changes with a message pointing to the current commit on `master`, and push:

    cd $repo
    git add .
    git commit -m "Sync documentation with master @ $rev"
    git push
